Title: Posterdesign for Exhibitions

Today we printed some posters I designed for a group show, so I take some time to write about making posters for exhibitions. Like every event, exhibitions need some kind of advertisement, too. In November 2014 I already worked on the design for *Preis der Medienkunst 2014* (Media Art award 2014) and now for the upcoming group show in Belfast *Orpheus B*

### Preis der Medienkunst 2014 (Media Art award 2014)

The Media Art Award is a yearly Exhibition with a prize money of 3000â‚¬ for the best student works in the course Media Art & Design at the Bauhaus University. Nominated are 8 degree works, selected by each chair.  
The professorships are:
 
* Documentary and Experimental Film
* Electro-acoustic Composition and Sound Design
* Experimental Radio
* Experimental Television
* Design of Medial Environments
* Interface Design
* Media Events
* Media, Trend and Public Appearance
* Multimedia Narration

So the exhibition is a mixture of extremely different works from Animation to Soundinstallation. In the year 2013 they called the exhibition "The Ones" and their Design was very colorful with a typeface that reminded me on digital clocks.  
In our first group discussion we decided to call the exhibition "Preis der Medienkunst 2014" and we wanted to build an 8 sided object, which should  be given to the winner as a physical prize. This Octahedron should resemble the 8 proffesorships, which are extremely diverse but have a connection as they all deal with *media*. The posterdesign should deal with the 8 sided sculpture, too.  
Euginio, one of the italian erasmus students, was working on the model. First he made prototypes by cutting potatoes, then modeled it in 3D programm and printed and folded the final sculpture. It was very hard for him to make an irregular and nice looking octahedron. The result reminded me on a handaxe from ancient times, which was the first human tool. (I love that analogy)  
I took the 3D model and created a two dimensional poster out of. My first draft was quite colorful and it kind of makes me think of a detergent product. Then it got more and more minimalistic after time. I had a lot of skype calls with [Gunnar Green](http://thegreeneyl.com) and after every call I worked on smaller details in typography and the layout. In the end I am really proud of the finished version, even though I wanted to print it with white color on black paper, but made it Offset.

### Orpheus B
The group exhibition is organized by 2<sup>nd</sup> year Fine Art students of the University of Ulster in Belfast, where I do my Erasmus at the moment. The exhibtion is part of the curriculum for students who are in the Sculpture & Lense course and should give student artists the oppurtinity to exhibit in a gallery.  
The former School of Art is currently getting reconstructed. The Campus Jordanstown will join the Campus Belfast. Part of the reconstruction is the demolition of the [Orpheus Building](http://www.futurebelfast.com/orpheus-building.html). The building was build in 1932 and was part of the Co-Operative society and in their was a dancehall in the upper floors, where couple fell in love with. So not only students feel sad about the decision to demolish instead of renovating the building. Currently this building is used by the Fine Art Department and the students have to move to the new one opposit the street in mid June.  
So the name resembles the buildings name in addition of the letter B, which is the floor where all the mental Sculpture and Lens students have their studio.  
I was working together with [Dan Moxham](https://danmoxham.wordpress.com/) on the design and on our first brainstorming session we decided for two conceptual options. Either we go with the mythology of Orpheus or we make an iconic graphic of a falling building, which was decided democratically.  

Orpheus was a singer and poet in greek mythology and when he sang all the wild animals would piecefully sit around him and even the stones started crying. He could even convince Hades in the underworld to release his wife Eurydice. That's how good he was. Hades told him not to look back on the way out and after a while Orpheus could'nt hear the footsteps of his wife, so he glimpsed back and she was sent back to hell. After that tragic moment he put his back to all women. (some said he made love with young boys, though) The only person not on Orpheus friendlist was Dyonisos, the god wine, ritual madness, fertility, theatre and religious ecstasy. So a group of Bacchantes---mad drinking women, celebrating orgies to worship Dyonisos---went after Orpheus and chopped his head of and threw it in the river Hebros. His head eventually got to the island Lesbos, still singing (of course this badass is immortal) until Apollo told him to shut the fu*k up.  
That's why I was looking for an creative commons painting I could redesign to use it as our poster and I found a painting by [Gregorio Lazzarini ](http://worldsofimagination.co.uk/spell%20Mindless%20Rage.htm), where the Bacchantes are just about to remove Orpheus' head from his shoulders.

Unfortunately not alot of people liked the painting as much as I did, so we democratically decided to make the iconized falling building instead. While I was working on Photoshop, Dan told me what to change and what to keep. I wanted to see how different types of CMYK pink would look like as the background and Dan told me to keep it that way. So we ended upper with a full colorpallet of pink and green and I love it. The A6 Flyers look amazing!
