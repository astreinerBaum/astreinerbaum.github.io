Everybody knows it by now, everybody talks about it. I do, too. Instead of watching the solar eclipse I turned to the other side and made a short timelapse video. On the rooftop of the University of Ulster, everybody was standing there with their pinhole boxes over their heads. At the time when the moon almost completely covered the sun I started to make pictures every 30 seconds. For a couple minutes you could even see a **Rainbow**!
