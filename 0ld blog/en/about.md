Welcome to my internetlog!
I write about stuff here and you can read it if you want. Currently I am a student of the Media Art and Design course in Weimar (Bauhaus University). My interests lie in Interactive Installations, Performance Art and Conceptualism. With my works I try to combine my affinity to Technology and Philosophy.
