I created BlockFont in the course <a href="https://www.uni-weimar.de/kunst-und-gestaltung/wiki/GMU:Wild_Type">Wild Type</a>.The Idea was to create a a font that looked like a waveform, so I used processing to draw lines from the bottom to the top of the letter and as it turned out some browsers show the interlacing in color, which is pretty interesting. <br> 
Try out Blockfont in the text box:</br>

<textarea name="Text1" cols="40"></textarea>

<p class="testfont">

    when we are lonely and careworn and suffering—at such times, what we want is to be seen.

An invisible mass alters the orbit of a comet; dark energy affects the acceleration of a supernova; the earth’s magnetic field tugs on birds, butterflies, sea turtles, and the compasses of mariners. The whole realm of the visible is compelled by the invisible. Our planet, our solar system, our galaxy, our universe: all of it, all of us, are pushed, pulled, spun, shifted, set in motion, and held together by what we cannot see.
