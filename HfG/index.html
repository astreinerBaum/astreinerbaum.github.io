    <h1>Hello Hochschule!</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for inviting me and I hope you have fun scrolling through my assignments.
        <br> I know this is a very web 1.0 experience – style w/o a stylesheet – but at least it is responsive and hyperfast.
        <br> <i> Very brutalist, much a e s t h e t i c ☻ </i>
        <br> I have the feeling none of the assignments fit very well to what I am doing, so I will try to explain myself by
        answering
        <br> the assignment for Moving Images.
        <br> The other assignment I chose is that for Digital Media, where I initially thought I could fit in, because I am interested 
        in code and want to learn more about creating critical games (not only digital, but also LARPs and hybrids)
        <br>
