    <h1>Welcome to Room 103</h1>
    <p>
       <i> Question: Do you have ideas that you would like to develop? </i>
        <br> Answer: Yes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i> Q: What are the areas of interest?</i>
        <br> 
        A: I get excited about a lot of things very fast. But my main interest (of course) is how new technologies inbed
        themselves in society and change human behaviour. In the past I had several research topics including Buddhism, Superorganisms
        like Ants, Attention Economy, Rating Systems, Big Data, Machine Learning, Public Art, Conceptual Art and Activism,
        Russian Trolls [...] Q: What would you like to investigate?
        <br>
        <br>
        A: There are several things I am investigating at the moment, one of which, as stated before, is how rating systems
        are implemented online, but also found themselves into the analog world. One example I thought was interesting was
        at the airport in Vienna after the <a href="img/viennaairport.jpg"> security check</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Q: Where do you position yourself at this moment as future author?</i>
        <br> 
        A: I consider myself to be a part of a group of artists who try to directly comment on the internet at large.
        As the internet is ubiquitous nowadays some of them are called "Post-Internet-Artists". Maybe I am late stage post-internet.
        Maybe we shoul invent a new term...
        <br>
        <br>
        Q: At which interest areas, mediums and apart from your private projects are
        you interested making part of collective works?
        <br> 
        A: I am always happy to help other artists with interesting projects that involve programming. Working for an with
        others helps me to find interesting tasks and creative solutions. Also I am very happy to create and curate exhibitions
        and their
        <a href="http://xn--mp8h.pitscher.net/">promotional</a> material.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Q: Why did you choose this University?</i>
        A: I don't know. It's kind of a media art institution, right?
        <br>
        <br>
        <i> Q: What do you expect from the University?</i>
        <br> 
        A: Basically I just want to find new friends, have fun and develop my artistic career.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i> Q: What do you expect from the teacher? </i>
        <br>
        A: Some input would be cool every now and then, but I see my teachers more as friends and colleagues, so I hope
        to discuss art on eye level.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Q: Do you want to be part of the Moving Images Students?</i>
        <br> A: I guess...
