       You found my Website!                                
       But why is it so ugly?                               
       What you are looking at is a regular .txt file.      
       The beautiful thing about these sort of text         
       files is that you can not style them. The only       
       styling you can do is the same you can do with a     
       typewriter. Recently I developed a healthy           
       obsession with text files.                           
       Did you know that they can be 0kb?                   
       Check /empty.txt if you want to see one in your      
       browser.
